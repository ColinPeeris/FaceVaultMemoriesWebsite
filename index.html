    <h1>Face Vault Memories</h1>
    <p>Face Vault Memories is a media management software that allows users to organise their media files (both images
        and videos). The software also runs facial recognition on all media files and displays the faces of people found
        in the media files. The user can then add names to the faces so that the software can identify these faces
        automatically in the future.</p>

    <p>Please note that this software is still under development and work is still ongoing to stabilize the code. Facial
        recognition is also currently just functional at most and not world-class. So manage your expectations.</p>
